1. reset sequence - should go to the blank screen after 10 retries, then ecu should restart again in 10 minutes, to preserve power and screen (sleep mode?)
2. Debug- I don't know what happens when MCU hangs etc. -> handlig via MQTT?
3.After adding more code, there ram issue happens - Wifi can not be initialized. To investigate
4. wifi crashes on micropython> v1.22 - for now it is 1.20


TODO:
1. making screen update asynchronous - now it blocks MCU for 15 because it waits in while loop for IDLE pin to go down - can be just sampled every second or something like that (and put semaphor hehe - or reading IDLE directly if function wants to update display)
2. Mock screen - to quickly see GUI update, not to wait until MQTT frame

IDEAS:
1.Control through MQTT - powering screen off etc.

BLOCKERS:
1. After adding code for declaring two dictonaries there is no space for WiFi init:
E (3098) wifi:Expected to init 10 rx buffer, actual is 5
micropython v. 1.22, will try flash 1.20 - update - works fine with 1.21

2. after loading init values (-99 etc) and displaying it causes all screen go red - GUI elements (rectangles etc. does not handle (-) values)
